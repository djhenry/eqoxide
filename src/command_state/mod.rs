//! `CommandState` — the single typed facade over the **view → model COMMAND** (write-path) IPC slots.
//!
//! The write path today is untyped: a UI click-handler or an HTTP handler reaches into a raw
//! request slot (`Arc<Mutex<Option<T>>>`, grouped by domain in [`crate::ipc`]) with
//! `*slot.lock().unwrap() = Some(..)`, and the `eq-net` thread's `ActionLoop::tick` drains it with
//! `slot.lock().unwrap().take()`. `CommandState` puts ONE typed method in front of each of those
//! slots so no call site pokes an `Arc<Mutex<..>>` by hand.
//!
//! It is **behavior-preserving plumbing, not new logic.** `CommandState` holds `.clone()`s of the
//! SAME `ipc` bundle Arcs that are also handed to `ActionLoop` and `HttpState`, so a `request_*`
//! write and the matching `take_*` drain touch the exact same cell the old direct access did. That
//! shared-Arc identity is what lets a domain migrate one file at a time without any behavior change:
//! a migrated `request_*` and an un-migrated `*slot.lock() = ..` still land in the same slot.
//!
//! SCOPE: the **command / action** domains only — Combat, Merchant, Inventory, Interact, Quest,
//! Group, Guild, Trainer, Social, Chat, plus the movement commands (Nav goto/follow/stop, Camera
//! manual-move, Lifecycle exit/respawn). It does **not** absorb the read-path published snapshots
//! (`GameState`, merchant/inventory/group rosters, nav status, …) — those stay on the model/read
//! side. A few `ipc` bundles physically carry a snapshot field alongside their command slots (e.g.
//! `MerchantSlots.merchant`); `CommandState` holds the whole bundle for construction convenience but
//! deliberately exposes methods over the COMMAND slots only. Do NOT add snapshot getters here.
//!
//! Forward-compatible with A3 (Command-with-result): A3 will add result-returning variants
//! (`request_*_await`, generalizing the existing `oneshot` reply used by `FrameReq`/`WhoReq`)
//! WITHOUT renaming anything below — that is why the fire-and-forget writes are `request_*`, not a
//! bare verb.
//!
//! ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//! HOW TO MIGRATE A DOMAIN  (Wave-2 fan-out: LIGHT migration — leave shared structs/signatures alone)
//! ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//! `combat.rs` is the fully-migrated reference — copy its shape. For your domain `<d>`:
//!
//! 1. NAMING. In `command_state/<d>.rs`, fill the `impl CommandState {}` shell with two kinds of
//!    method, all reading `self.<d>.<slot>` (your bundle is already a field on this struct):
//!      • `request_<verb>(args)`  — the write the VIEW makes (UI + HTTP). Sets `Some(..)` into the
//!        slot. Name it after the domain verb; prefix with the domain where a bare verb could
//!        collide with another domain's method (e.g. `request_group_invite`, not `request_invite`).
//!      • `take_<thing>() -> Option<T>` — the drain the `ActionLoop` makes once per tick. Returns
//!        `slot.lock().unwrap().take()`.
//! 2. SLOT LOCATION. The slots already live in your `ipc::<D>Slots` bundle, held as the private
//!    `<d>` field on `CommandState` (see the struct below). You do not add fields or touch this
//!    file's struct — just read `self.<d>.<slot>` from your methods.
//! 3. TWO CALL-SITE EDITS. Point both ends of each slot at the new methods:
//!      • VIEW writes → method: `*s.<d>.<slot>.lock().unwrap() = Some(x)` becomes
//!        `s.command.request_<verb>(x)` in `http/<d>.rs`, and `*cx.acts.<slot>.lock()… = Some(x)`
//!        becomes `cx.acts.command.request_<verb>(x)` in `ui/windows/<d>.rs`.
//!      • MODEL drain → `take_*`: in `action_loop.rs`, `self.<d>.<slot>.lock().unwrap().take()`
//!        becomes `self.command.take_<thing>()` (each domain's drain lives in its own `drain_<d>`
//!        method — non-adjacent, so parallel Wave-2 branches auto-merge here).
//! 4. DO NOT remove the `<d>` bundle field or touch any `fn` signature. Leaving the now-dead field
//!    in place is DELIBERATE: it keeps every Wave-2 branch off the shared lines (`CommandState`'s
//!    struct/`new()`, `main.rs`, `http/mod.rs`, `ui/mod.rs`, `ActionLoop::new`/`run_login_flow`/
//!    `spawn_camera_server` signatures) so the branches don't collide. A SINGLE final cleanup PR
//!    removes all the dead bundle fields + trims those signatures at once, and drops the
//!    `#[allow(dead_code)]`. (`combat.rs` is the reference for the METHOD shape; note combat also
//!    already removed its field — that is the eventual end state, NOT what a Wave-2 domain does.)
