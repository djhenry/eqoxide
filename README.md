# eqoxide

[![Asset server: eqoxide_asset_server](https://img.shields.io/badge/asset%20server-eqoxide__asset__server-blue?logo=github)](https://github.com/djhenry/eqoxide_asset_server)

A lightweight EverQuest/EQEmu client. It connects to an
EQEmu server, relies on eqoxide asset server for content, renders the zone in 3D (wgpu), and exposes a local **HTTP API** so an agent (or
any script) can drive the client — move, hail NPCs, target, fight, buy, capture frames, and more.
It can log in as a **GM observer** or as a **regular player character** that actually plays
(see [`docs/autonomous-play.md`](docs/autonomous-play.md)).

## Feature status

Legend: ✅ **working** (implemented & verified) · 🟡 **in progress** · 🔵 **planned** · 🐞 **known bug/limitation**

### Connection, session & travel
| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Login as GM observer | ✅ | Direct connect to local EQEmu (login `127.0.0.1:5999`) |
| Login as a regular player character | ✅ | Plays for real; per-character config in `~/.config/eqoxide/` |
| Multiple instances side-by-side | ✅ | Auto-binds next free HTTP port from 8765; prints `API_PORT=` |
| Graceful shutdown (`POST /v1/lifecycle/exit`) | ✅ | Per-instance; never `pkill` |
| Zone-line travel (`POST /v1/navigate/zone_cross`) | ✅ | Sends target zone id; verified both ways (e.g. qcat↔qeynos) |
| Auto walk-into a zone line | 🐞 | Rarely fires — server sends arrival, not trigger, coords; use `/v1/navigate/zone_cross` |
| Derived-asset sync from `eqoxide_asset_server` | ✅ | Models, textures, string table, maps fetched over HTTP into XDG cache |

### Rendering
| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Zone terrain + placed objects/buildings | ✅ | ActorInstance placements; NPCs sit among buildings |
| Per-race + per-gender character models | ✅ | All 15 playable races, skinned animation, idle/walk/combat clips |
| Correct relative race sizes (EQ feet) | ✅ | From `GetRaceGenderDefaultHeight`; robust true_height (no stray-vert inflation) |
| Equipment **armor** textures | ✅ | Material-driven swaps, tint, WearChange |
| **Weapon** models in hand + swing animation | ✅ | Verified on elf-female; NPC weapons & generic hand-joint = follow-up |
| Doors: clickable, animated, portal-zoning | ✅ | Geometry/placement correct; **untextured** (texture pass pending) |
| Smooth NPC movement (velocity dead-reckoning) | ✅ | Receives unreliable position updates |
| Frame capture (`GET /v1/observe/frame` → PNG) | ✅ | Used for visual verification |
| World handedness / left-right mirror | ✅ | Fixed (clip-space X + A/D controls) |
| Helms / hair / head armor | 🔵 | Attached-model subsystem not built yet |
| Outdoor-zone vertical placement | 🐞 | Some outdoor zones (e.g. qeytoqrg) render terrain with a Z offset |

### Gameplay & automation (HTTP API)
| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Movement: walk `POST /v1/navigate/goto` (A* pathfinding) | ✅ | Routes around walls within connected areas; stalls across closed doors |
| Movement: teleport `POST /v1/navigate/warp` | ✅ | Anti-cheat capped (~50–95u/hop); small hops from a synced state |
| Combat: auto-attack / auto-face / auto-retarget | ✅ | Heading-scale fix made melee land; hands-free grinding works |
| Spell casting (`POST /v1/combat/cast`, gems, cast bar) | ✅ | `OP_CastSpell` + begin/mana/interrupt feedback |
| Scribe / memorize spells (`POST /v1/combat/scribe`, `/v1/combat/memorize`) | ✅ | |
| Pets: tracking, auto-pet-combat, recall | ✅ | `OP_PetCommands`; squishy classes stand off |
| Target / consider / hail / say | ✅ | `/v1/combat/target`, `/v1/combat/target/name`, `/v1/combat/consider`, `/v1/interact/hail`, `/v1/interact/say` |
| Merchant buy / sell / trade window | ✅ | `/v1/merchant/buy`, `/v1/merchant/sell`, `/trade/*`; live-verified buy (item + coin) |
| Loot corpses (`POST /v1/interact/loot`) | ✅ | Auto-loot queues own kills; takes listed items |
| Quest hand-in (`POST /v1/interact/give`) + quest log (`/v1/quests/log`) | ✅ | Trade items to an NPC for turn-ins; also: completed history, task offer/accept/cancel |
| Inventory read / move (`GET /v1/observe/inventory`, `/v1/inventory/move`) | ✅ | |
| Doors API (`GET /v1/observe/doors`, `POST /v1/interact/click_door`) | ✅ | |
| Water-region detection + swim navigation | ✅ | `.wtr` BSP; swim-descent in `find_path` |
| Controlled-fall navigation + fall damage | 🟡 | Drop off ledges to a lower floor + client-side `OP_EnvDamage`; not yet exhaustively live-tested (curve tuning, water/levitate negation) |

### HUD / UI
| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Movable / resizable / persistent windows | ✅ | Per-character `ui_layout_<Name>.json`; `Ctrl+L` lock |
| Action grid (attack, sit/stand, target, consider, spell gems) | ✅ | Real TGA gem icons + cast bar |
| Map window (toggle, `M` key) | ✅ | Closeable; default closed |

### Offline / dev tooling
| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `--testzone` offline zone/asset debugging (no server) | ✅ | |
| `render_model --race <CODE>` skinned model viewer | ✅ | Renders a character exactly like the client (login-free); GPU skinning readback diagnostic |
| `--profile` / `EQ_PROFILE=1` frame-timing overlay | ✅ | Per-phase timings; see `docs/dev-workflow.md` |

## Build & Run

```sh
cargo build --release
./dev-run.sh           # release build; auto-restarts on rebuild/crash
./dev-run.sh debug     # debug build
```

Run `dev-run.sh` in your **own terminal**, not from an agent/Bash tool call — the harness reaps
GUI child processes. Logs go to `/tmp/eqoxide.log`. Per-character server/credentials and
renderer asset paths live in `~/.config/eqoxide/` (honoring `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`). Credential files
are kept out of source control — copy a template into that directory and edit it locally.

Offline asset/zone debugging (no server): `./target/release/eqoxide --testzone`.

Add `--profile` (or `EQ_PROFILE=1`) for a per-phase frame-timing overlay; see `docs/dev-workflow.md`.

### Choosing which character logs in

The account + character to log in as is **not** a CLI name argument — it comes from the login
config file. Login configs live in `~/.config/eqoxide/`. Pass one with `--config`:

```sh
./target/release/eqoxide --config durgan   # ~/.config/eqoxide/config-durgan.yaml
```

`--config` accepts:
- a **profile name** (`durgan`) → `~/.config/eqoxide/config-durgan.yaml`
- a **bare filename** (`config-durgan.yaml`) → looked up in `~/.config/eqoxide/`
- an explicit **path** (`./foo.yaml`, `~/elsewhere/x.yaml`) → used as-is

With no `--config`, the client loads `~/.config/eqoxide/config.yaml`. Each `config-<name>.yaml`
sets its own `account.username`, `account.password`, and `account.character_name`. To add a
character, copy an existing file in `~/.config/eqoxide/`, edit those three fields (the
account/character must already exist on the EQEmu server), and pass its name to `--config`.

```sh
ls ~/.config/eqoxide/config-*.yaml          # available login profiles
grep character_name ~/.config/eqoxide/config-*.yaml
```

### Launching from inside an agent harness (no interactive terminal)

`dev-run.sh` assumes its own terminal. If you must launch from a Bash tool call (where the harness
reaps GUI children), detach with `setsid` so the process survives, then read the printed
`API_PORT=` line:

```sh
setsid bash -c 'XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/$(id -u) DISPLAY=:0 WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-0 \
  exec ./target/release/eqoxide --config durgan' \
  > /tmp/eq_durgan.log 2>&1 < /dev/null &
disown
sleep 12
PORT=$(grep -m1 -oP 'API_PORT=\K[0-9]+' /tmp/eq_durgan.log)   # do not hardcode 8765
grep -E "entering world as|sent ReqClientSpawn" /tmp/eq_durgan.log   # confirm zone-in
```

Requires the local EQEmu server (login `127.0.0.1:5999`) and a running X/Wayland session on
display `:0`.

## Running multiple instances at once

The client supports **several instances side by side** — e.g. one per git worktree, so multiple
agents can work on different features simultaneously without interfering.

- **Auto-port binding.** Each instance binds the **next free** HTTP API port starting at
  `config.yaml` `http_port` (default **8765**), scanning upward: 8765, 8766, 8767, …
- **Port is printed to stdout.** On launch the client prints a single parseable line (also in
  `/tmp/eqoxide.log`). **Always read this — do not hardcode 8765:**

  ```
  API_PORT=8766
  ```

  ```sh
  PORT=$(grep -m1 -oP 'API_PORT=\K[0-9]+' /tmp/eqoxide.log)
  curl "http://127.0.0.1:$PORT/v1/observe/debug"
  ```

- **Shut down your own instance with `POST /v1/lifecycle/exit`** — never `pkill eqoxide`, which could
  kill another worktree's client. `/v1/lifecycle/exit` cleanly stops only the instance on the port you call:

  ```sh
  curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:$PORT/v1/lifecycle/exit"     # 200 "shutting down", then the process exits
  ```
